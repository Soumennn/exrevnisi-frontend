                    <p>
                        We are driven by nothing but mission. We are on a mission to tackle some of the most
                        difficult problems humanity is having, education is one of them. We believe our own
                        personal problems, achievements and pride are far less important than what we are
                        trying to solve here. Not just solving the issues, but we are also building the few greatest
                        products the world has ever seen. We do care about individuals and talent.

                    <p>
                        Innovators and creators. <br />
                        We don't accept things. We challenge things. <br />
                        We don't assume. We experiment. <br />
                        We don't build. We create. <br />
                        The work culture we have is only suitable for creators and innovators. We never
                        compromise and go around the corner. We are looking for self-motivated, energetic and
                        creative people, who take initiatives and risks. You must be in love with your work.

                        We are looking for people who are looking for work not a job. We don’t micromanage but
                        we are strict. If you are not hard working, enthusiastic and possess a good character,
                        sooner or later we won’t be together. We provide immense creative freedom and
                        personal growth. We just do not expect you to fulfill the target, but you need to gobeyond what has been asked to you. NOt only going beyond the asked, We also want
                        you to speak boldly and tell us what could be and should be done.
